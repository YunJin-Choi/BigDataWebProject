					<b>1. Customer Engagement & Personalization Will Continue to Change
					the Consumer–Brand Relationship</b><br>
					<br> From embedded chatbots optimizing online conversations to
					limited-time offers pinged to mobile devices while shopping the
					aisles, brands and retailers are finding new ways to speak to and
					engage consumers.<br>
					<br> And because these new standards of customization are now
					expected from your consumers, a personalized customer experience is
					no longer a nice to have, it’s a need to have.<br>
					<br> The Holy Grail for marketers has always been the right
					message delivered at the right time to the right consumer in the
					right context. As digital marketing influencer Jeff Bullas blogs,
					“Relevance is king for catching a distracted eye and online glance
					in a noisy world of data clutter.” We are now finally able to tap
					into technology that knows—in real time—customers’ likes, dislikes,
					buying patterns, online and offline behaviors, and shopping
					journeys. Brands that listen to their data and use personalization
					to drive the customer journey will win.<br>
					<br><b> 2. Identity Resolution Will Bring Omnichannel into
					Maturity</b><br>
					<br> The ability to identify and connect with a single
					consumer across devices and channels will take personalization one
					step further. This ability to follow an audience on a 1:1 level
					(without cookie limitations) is changing the way brands engage with
					consumers. Marketers can create unique experiences across your
					tablet, smartphone, and desktop—but all a continuation of the same
					shopping journey. And with digital consumers using more devices
					than ever—as many as 10 per person by 2020 if you believe Michael
					Dell—marketers will be challenged more than ever to build a
					complete view of consumer, place, and purchase.<br>
					<br> With less than 20% of marketers currently able to really
					connect the dots of consumer presence, identity resolution vendors
					will become a critical weapon in the marketer’s arsenal beginning
					in 2017. The rewards will be great—the ability to identify a single
					consumer among online and offline channels will truly bring the
					term omnichannel to maturity.<br>
					<br><b> 3. New Ad Formats Will Disrupt the Traditional Media Plan</b><br>
					<br> Zenith predicts digital revenues will exceed TV globally
					for the first time next year, making digital the world’s largest
					advertising medium. From social video to programmatic digital
					audio, next-generation formats will disrupt the conventional media
					plan and force strategists to rethink the tried and true. Take the
					immersive and personal nature of digital audio—“earbud moments”
					present an opportunity to connect with consumers across dayparts—a
					gold mine for marketers seeking a programmatic means to elusive
					audiences like Millennials.<br>
					<br> A recent AdAge study projects that the percentage of
					media buying strategy dedicated to digital audio will nearly double
					in the next two years. Innovative, location-powered targeting will
					enable marketers to plan campaigns using layers of location,
					interest, and spend data. And with programmatic tools, marketers
					will be able to efficiently assess performance and optimize in real
					time.<br>
					<br> <b>4. How You Use the Data Will Set Your Brand Apart</b><br>
					<br> The CMO of the future must also be the CDO—Chief Data
					Officer. With the explosion of data from demographic to behavioral
					to location and transactional scattered throughout departmental
					silos, marketers must find ways to access and understand all of it
					to form a holistic view of the customer. Data visualization tools
					will simplify the interpretation component of data analysis, but
					the sheer volume of data—and new streams, like locations visited,
					card spend, and in-store movement—will require new skillsets within
					the brand organization and among its marketing partners.
