					<b>Top 3 Instagram Marketing Trends for 2017</b>
				</h3>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">
					<b>#1: Clickable Links Finally Come to Instagram Photos</b><br> <br>
					For years, the only place you’ve been able to click on a link in
					Instagram is through the link in your bio. Brands, influencers, and
					small businesses have had to get creative when it comes to making
					sales and driving traffic through Instagram, which is why the
					phrase “Link in bio!” is so popular on Instagram.
				</p>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">Shoppable Instagram
					feeds that leverage the link in your bio, like Later’s Linkin.bio
					product, are exploding in popularity, and with new features like
					Instagram shopping and clickable URLs in Instagram Stories for
					verified users, we’re betting that 2017 will be the year Instagram
					grows up as a marketing platform and finally brings clickable links
					to Instagram posts.</p><br>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">
					However, even though Instagram has been looking a lot more like
					Facebook lately, we don’t think that clickable links on Instagram
					photos will be as simple as clicking on a URL. Expect something
					more creative that fits well with the existing Instagram
					experience, but also caters to the brands and businesses that
					Instagram wants to attract as customers.<br>
					<br><b> #2: Instagram Starts to Seriously Drive Sales in 2017</b><br>
					<br> 2016 was the year that Instagram grew up as a platform,
					offering new business profiles and Instagram analytics for the
					first time, in an effort to entice more businesses to use the
					platform and purchase ads. But you don’t have to create an
					Instagram ad to make sales, and in 2017 retailers can expect a big
					increase in revenue from Instagram.

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">
					Why?<br>
					 Consumers are spending more time than ever on mobile
					devices, and mobile internet traffic is now greater than desktop.<br>
					<br> 78% of consumers make purchasing decisions that are
					influenced by a brand’s social media, and 70% of Instagram users
					have searched for a brand on Instagram.<br>
					<br> In 2017, look for more brands to bring the shopping and
					buying experience straight to their customer’s Instagram feeds.
					Instagram is the perfect platform to drive sales for online
					retailers because it is both visual and mobile-first, and has
					gained a lot of trust from it’s users as it’s seen as a more
					“authentic” channel than Twitter or Facebook.<br>
					<br> nstagram feeds are becoming the new storefront, and a
					major Instagram marketing trend in 2017 will be online retailers
					using user-generated content (UGC) from Instagram to help drive
					sales on their website. Whether that’s with Instagram gallery pages
					on their product pages or re-posting community content featuring
					their products in “real life,” successful marketers and business
					owners will be investing in selling through Instagram in 2017.<br>
					<br> Relatedly, another major marketing trend for 2017 will be
					aligning social objectives and KPI’s with the larger business and
					marketing goals of an organization. In short, 2017 is the year that
					social becomes accountable to tracking cold, hard dollars through
					acquisition and conversion. Gone are the days when likes and
					followers are all that matters, and in 2017 we can expect Instagram
					marketing to be taken as seriously as other digital marketing
					channels – and to be driving some serious sales.<br>
					<br><b> #3: 2017 is the Year Instagram Stories Dominates Snapchat</b><br>
					<br> One of the main differences between Instagram and
					Snapchat stories has been the lack of fun filters, geo-filters, and
					stickers in Instagram Stories – until recently. At the end of 2016,
					Instagram launched stickers, which looks almost identical to
					Snapchat’s stickers. You can find customizable stickers for the
					weather, the current time, and even your location, just like you
					can on Snapchat.<br>
					<br> So what’s left for Instagram Stories to copy? Snapchat’s
					signature puppy filter, of course. Facebook acquired MSQRD, a video
					app that lets you add “filters” to faces in early 2016, and by the
					end of the year we got the first taste of what MSQRD in Facebook
					would look like with Messenger’s new camera.<br>
					<br> Messenger’s new camera looks and behaves eerily like
					Snapchat, with the ability to add face filters, stickers, and
					borders to your photos or videos. In 2017, expect these same
					filters to come to Instagram Stories, which may just be the final
					nail in the coffin for Snapchat. Marketers should invest in
					building their Instagram Stories strategy now, because it’s only
					going to grow even faster in 2017.<br>
					<br> That being said, don’t count Snapchat out entirely – they
					have been the innovators in this space, creating fun growth hacks
					to boost user engagement with features like FaceSwap and puppy
					filters, and it’s likely that Snapchat could come out with
					something new that blows Instagram Stories away.
