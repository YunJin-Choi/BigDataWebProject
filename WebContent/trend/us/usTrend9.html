					<b>1) Doctors Becoming Employees.</b><br>
					<br> In response to changes in regulations, as a result of the
					Affordable Care Act of 2010, hospitals have been buying up
					physician practices at an accelerated rate. They are forming
					integrated systems so they are better able to coordinate care among
					physicians, hospitals and other parts of the healthcare delivery
					system. Doctors are becoming employees.<br>
					<br> According to a Jackson Healthcare survey of physicians:<br>
					<br>  ▍ 21% of physicians in all specialties are employed by a
					hospital.<br>  ▍ 14% are employed in a single or
					multi-specialty owned by a hospital.<br> ▍  14% are employed by
					a privately owned single or multi-specialty clinic.<br>  ▍  9%
					are employed as independent contractors or Locums.<br>  ▍ The
					number of primary care physicians employed by hospitals increased
					from 10% in 2012 to 20% in 2014.<br>
					<br> When doctors become employees, they lose their ability to
					be final decision makers when it comes to buying medical services
					and products. Instead, they are part of a purchasing process
					comprised of a number of people and, most likely, a group
					purchasing organization. Doctors still have a key role as
					advocates, but others now make the final purchasing decision.

					<b>2) Consumers Becoming Avid Researchers.</b><br>
					<br> And if that’s not enough, here comes the Internet and
					today’s healthcare consumer. They are no longer content to blindly
					accept what a doctor tells them. They do their homework before
					visiting a doctor. They research their conditions and treatment
					options after visiting a doctor as well. They see healthcare as a
					collaboration between themselves and their doctors. They take
					responsibility for their health and the decisions that affect it.
					The doctor no longer has the only say on treatment, hospitals,
					medications, etc.<br>
					<br> According to Pew Research:<br>
					<br> * One in three American adults have gone online to figure
					out a medical condition.<br>  ▍ 72% of Internet users say they
					looked online for health information within the past year.<br>
					 ▍ 47% of Internet users search for information about doctors or
					other health professionals.<br>  ▍ 38% of Internet users search
					for information about hospitals and other medical facilities.<br>
					 ▍ The most commonly researched topics are specific diseases or
					conditions; treatments or procedures; and doctors or other health
					professionals.<br>
					<br> <b>3) Marketers Targeting Consumers and Payers.</b><br>
					<br> There are different audiences for healthcare marketers,
					although they are all being affected by the changes to the U.S.
					healthcare delivery environment. The major players include
					healthcare consumers, providers and payers. They constitute the
					primary “who”, depending on the product or service offered.<br>
					<br> The MM&M /Ogilvy CommonHealth Healthcare Marketers Trend
					Report 2016 covers pharmaceutical, biotech, medical devices and
					diagnostic companies. Physicians continue to be the most important
					group for these companies with 93% of respondents stating that they
					belonged to their leading three target groups. They were followed
					by payers and patients (consumers) with each about 56% of
					respondents. It’s not surprising that doctors continue to be the
					primary marketing target. After all, they still buy, prescribe,
					recommend and advocate products and services.<br>
					<br> What is significant is that payers and consumers were
					picked by the same number of respondents as a target group, ahead
					of other providers, shareholders and advocacy groups. This may
					reflect the new reality of decision making in healthcare. Doctor
					decision making is gradually shrinking as decision making shifts to
					payers and healthcare consumers. The trend is for healthcare
					marketers to increasingly target consumers and payers, while still
					keeping doctors as the underpinning for their overall marketing
					strategy.<br>
					<br><b> 4) Digital Channels Overtaking Traditional Marketing.</b><br>
					<br> What we are seeing today is a continuation in trends that
					kicked into gear during the last couple of years. Digital channels
					are overtaking traditional marketing channels. This is actually
					true for all marketing sectors, including provider-to-consumer
					marketing.<br>
					<br> The MM&M study cited above shows that the greatest growth
					for the pharmaceutical, diagnostics, biotech and medical device
					marketing budgets is taking place in social media, mobile/tablet
					apps and digital sales materials. For consumer marketing tactics,
					the greatest growth is taking place in mobile/tablet apps, social
					media and digital ads. Hospital providers are also shifting to
					digital channels to market to healthcare consumers. It’s no wonder.<br>
					<br> According to Think with Google’sThe Digital Journey to
					Wellness: Hospital Selection:<br>
					<br>  ▍ 77% of patients use search engines prior to booking
					appointments.<br>  ▍ Search drives nearly three times as many
					visitors to hospital sites, compared to visitors from other
					referral sites.<br> ▍ 44% of patients who research hospitals
					on a mobile device schedule an appointment.<br>  ▍ Before the
					moment of conversion, patients typically search on symptoms and
					condition terms.<br>
					<br> <b>5) Digital Content is Key to the Decision Process.</b><br>
					<br> Prior to booking an appointment:<br>
					<br>  ▍ 77% of patients used search.<br>  ▍ 83% used
					hospital sites.<br>  ▍ 54% used health insurance company sites.<br>
					 ▍ 50% used health information sites.<br>  ▍ 26% used
					consumer-generated reviews.<br>
					<br> Healthcare marketers continue to adapt to the new reality
					brought about by the shift to payments based on outcomes,
					increasing transparency, and an empowered healthcare consumer.
					We're seeing growth in marketing budgets over the lows of 2013. The
					largest increases are going to digital marketing tactics.
