					<b>1. Creation of a real content marketing strategy</b><br>
					<br> In almost every keynote speech I give, I ask the audience
					members whether their organizations have a documented content
					marketing strategy. Sadly, most do not. Our research tells us that
					those organizations that do have one, and that review it
					consistently, are more likely to be successful. Even though you
					(the expert reading this) might think this is basic, it’s not. We
					are still too focused on campaigns and talking about our products,
					instead of truly driving value outside the products and services we
					offer.<br>
					<br> In answer to this, Content Marketing World offers a
					specific workshop solely on how to create a documented content
					marketing strategy. To get started now, this essential e-book on
					creating a strategy will get you pointed in the right direction.<br>
					<br> <b>2.Native advertising</b><br>
					<br> If you are a regular listener of the PNR: This Old
					Marketing podcast, you know that Robert Rose and I cover native
					advertising just about every week. I’ve often called native
					advertising the “gateway drug” to content marketing (in a good
					way). We are starting to see a number of enterprises experiment,
					and succeed, with paid, native promotion of their content.<br>
					<br> Why is this so important? Five years ago, enterprises
					were spending 80% on content creation and 20% on content promotion.
					I believe this ratio has switched, with successful enterprises
					creating differentiated content and putting some advertising and
					promotion muscle behind it.<br>
					<br> This is the first year that we are offering a dedicated
					track on native advertising at Content Marketing World. In
					addition, we have a panel on native with some of the leading
					experts in the world on the subject.<br>
					<br><b> 3. Influencer marketing</b><br>
					<br> Influencer marketing has always been a “thing,” but in
					the last six months … wow … this topic has vaulted into the top
					five. It seems that every enterprise has some kind of content and
					influencer strategy, but few organizations execute a real strategy
					that makes sense.<br>
					<br> The CMI team did an amazing job on the influencer
					marketing checklist (totally worth the download). For Content
					Marketing World, we have quite a few sessions on influencer
					marketing, including Bryan Kramer on how to create and manage an
					influencer marketing program.<br>
					<br> <b>4. Purpose-driven marketing</b><br>
					<br> What’s your why? Why do you create your content? Does it
					have a real impact on your customers and prospects? Is there a
					deeper purpose behind what you do, instead of just creating content
					as part of your sales and marketing machine?<br>
					<br> We have a number of sessions on finding your purpose at
					CMWorld this year, but we specifically recruited comedian Michael
					Jr. to talk about “why versus what.” If you haven’t had a chance to
					see this video on finding your why, here’s a sneak peek.<br>
					<br><b> 5. Video and visual</b><br>
					<br> It doesn’t take “Chewbacca Mom” to show us how big and
					important using video and having a visual storytelling strategy
					are. But, most brands are still hanging their video strategy on the
					viral video, instead of building a process and organization around
					the ongoing delivery of valuable information through video.<br>
					<br> We have a CMWorld track dedicated to visual content,
					including an excellent session on building a visual content
					marketing program that scales. In addition, we have the video
					architects behind the very successful visual/video programs at
					Marriott, Jyske Bank, and Foodable.TV.<br>
					<br><b> 6.Snapchat</b><br>
					<br> I have to be honest. I don’t get Snapchat, but enough of
					my smart colleagues have said it is here to stay. Since Snapchat
					has surpassed Facebook in total video views, it’s about time we
					started to take notice at Content Marketing World.<br>
					<br> Anyway, I broke down and asked Carlos Gil who heads
					social at BMC Software to teach us about Snapchat and the
					opportunities for business.<br>
					<br> <b>7. Facebook</b><br>
					<br> Well, most of us built our social houses on rented
					Facebook land, and now what do we have to show for it? Not much
					actually. But there is a better way, especially when it comes to
					promoting your content assets on this powerhouse of a channel.<br>
					<br> Although we have a number of sessions that discuss
					Facebook, I’m curious about the benefits of leveraging Facebook as
					a way to drive your content for lead generation. Brian Carter is
					putting on both a workshop and a session that will help you use
					Facebook as a demand-generation tool.<br>
					<br> <b>8.Teams and workflow</b><br>
					<br> I’ve seen so many examples of well-meaning content
					marketing programs die because of improper workflow and hiring
					inadequate people to make real content experiences.<br>
					<br> Among other sessions, Amanda Todorovich, Content Marketer
					of the Year finalist, is putting on a session dedicated to how her
					team built Cleveland Clinic’s content hub.<br>
					<br> <b>9.Content strategy (pipes and process)</b><br>
					<br> My take on both content strategy and intelligent content
					is that these core areas are about the pipes that the content moves
					through. Great content is one thing, but if you don’t build in a
					strategy that makes sense for a user experience or leverages
					technology in the right way, we are all doomed.<br>
					<br> When I think of content strategy, I think of people like
					Kristina Halvorson, Lisa Welchman, and, of course, Ann Rockley on
					the intelligent content side. We doubled down this year on sessions
					about setting up your content marketing process for success. To
					work properly over time, we need our processes to scale and be
					personalized. Most enterprises aren’t set up to do this outside of
					campaigns.<br>
					<br> <b>10.Mobile</b><br>
					<br> Pokémon Go anyone? How many times have you heard that
					INSERT YEAR HERE is the year of mobile? Well, with all audiences
					with at least one untethered device, that year may be now. To put
					it simply, if your content isn’t easily digested on a mobile
					device, you have significant problems.<br>
					<br> My good friend Jeff Rohrs, CMO at Yext, is putting on a
					mobile moments panel at CMWorld to look at the opportunities we
					might be missing, while we also added a new session this year on
					content design and the mobile device. We considered having a
					separate mobile track this year, but so many sessions integrate
					mobile — it’s the natural transformation where mobile is a priority
					with most of the digital content we develop.<br>
					<br> <b>11. Content technology</b><br>
					<br> With that out of the way, it only takes one loo at Scott
					Brinker’s mammoth marketing technology infographic to make any
					marketer hesitant of what technology to choose. So yes, we have a
					full track dedicated to technology and tools (and another 12
					sessions just on different content technologies), but I’m intrigued
					with Paul Roetzer’s session on machine learning. This is not just a
					futuristic look at content anymore, artificial intelligence and
					machine learning are here right now, and we need to start paying
					attention.<br>
					<br> <b>12. Writing</b><br>
					<br> Writing still counts, perhaps more than ever. More than
					not, marketers are abuzz about social media and video without
					comprehending that most of our communication is still text- and
					story-based. And frankly, most marketers are really bad at writing.
					From finding freelancers to becoming a better digital writer, we
					have more sessions dedicated to writing than ever (yes, even in
					this age of social media). And, of course, Ann Handley.<br>
					<br><b> 13.Integration with sales</b><br>
					<br> I had a great conversation with Marcus Sheridan a few
					years back. While he loved our programming at Content Marketing
					World 2014, he made me aware of a very sad truth: Most
					organizations are dominated by sales, and if we don’t start
					integrating salespeople into Content Marketing World, marketers are
					going to get back to their offices and hit brick walls.<br>
					<br> Marcus, as usual, was 100% correct, and Content Marketing
					World is evolving into a marketing AND sales conference. To prove
					that, we’ve added a full track dedicated to sales and sales
					integration this year, as well a workshop on how top-performing
					companies are integrating their sales and content led by Marcus and
					best-selling author of Same Side Selling, Ian Altman.<br>
					<br> <b>14. ROI and measurement</b><br>
					<br> I don’t think this one needs explaining. The No. 1
					question, every year, is “How do I show the success of my content
					marketing program?” At CMWorld this year we have more than 10
					sessions dedicated to driving ROI, performance, and sales with
					content. In the meantime, if you haven’t checked out this post by
					Michael Brenner on the secrets of content marketing ROI, please
					make the time.<br>
					<br> <b>15.Email and marketing automation</b><br>
					<br> I’ve learned a couple things about email recently. First,
					email is far from dead, and may be more important than ever for our
					content marketing programs. Second, most enterprises (99% of them)
					send spam disguised as content every day to our key stakeholders.<br>
					<br> And then, as many B2B enterprises have done, they move
					from just email into marketing automation. I talked to a senior
					strategist recently who believes that marketers use about 10% of
					the functionality behind marketing automation (10% is on the high
					side). Simply put, most of us are using marketing automation the
					wrong way.<br>
					<br> <b>16.Content distribution and promotion</b><br>
					<br> Again, the trend (rightfully so) seems to be moving from
					less content to more promotion. This is correct. No longer can we
					afford to create and execute on content projects without them ever
					seeing the light of day.<br>
					<br> <b>17. Executive buy-in</b><br>
					<br> We developed the content marketing documentary, The Story
					of Content: Rise of the New Marketing, specifically to help
					marketers like you with executive buy-in. It’s definitely helped,
					but we need to do more. Content marketing is an approach … a way of
					doing business if you will … and many executives we work with are
					still firmly set with the traditional four Ps model.<br>
					<br> <b>18.Global integration</b><br>
					<br> Content Marketing World attracted 40% of the Fortune 100
					in 2015. Every one of those organizations operates globally. This
					means complex processes, scattered teams, communication issues,
					politics, and varied customer experiences. Simply put, it’s hard.<br>
					<br> We’ve added a full global strategy track this year
					including sessions from the likes of Oracle and Rockwell
					Automation.<br>
					<br> <b>19.Construction of a media organization</b><br>
					<br> I’m fascinated by the movement of enterprises to becoming
					media companies. Red Bull Media House was, of course, one of the
					first to formally create a media company inside its organizations.
					PepsiCo and Mondelez recently announced their efforts to structure
					part of their content organizations as profit centers. This is a
					huge movement that has some momentum behind it.<br>
					<br> After Arrow Electronics (Fortune 500 manufacturer)
					purchased a number of media properties from UBM (parent company of
					Content Marketing Institute), we decided to reach out to them about
					their core strategy. Victor Gao, vice president of digital and
					managing director of Arrow Media Group, will be presenting the
					company’s strategy on building a media division through
					acquisition.
