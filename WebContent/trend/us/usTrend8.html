					<b>1.Immersive marketing</b><br>
					<br> The success of content marketing has been a mixed bag. It
					has given consumers entertaining, informative content. It has also
					seen a lot of rushed content published in the race to expand
					content volumes.<br>
					<br> This increased competition has seen market leaders and
					innovators look for new ways to engage their audience, and
					developments in various technologies are helping to drive this
					phenomenon.<br>
					<br> Both Facebook and YouTube have introduced 360-degree
					video, and some brands have already begun experimenting with the
					format for an interesting and innovative experience. Take a look at
					this 360-degree promo for Star Wars: Rogue One, or this effort from
					GoPro.<br>
					<br> <b>2.More live video</b><br>
					<br> Live video has suddenly become the internet’s favorite
					shiny new toy. When Meerkat entered the market it was an
					entertaining novelty. Now, Twitter (via Periscope), Facebook,
					YouTube, and Instagram have all released live video offerings as
					well.<br>
					<br> Many of these networks are promoting their live video
					quite heavily, and it’s something that will stand out in the
					saturated world of content, so I can see plenty of reasons why
					brands would want to get involved.<br>
					<br> An early example was BuzzFeed’s live stream of two
					employees trying to explode a watermelon using rubber bands. The
					video has had a total of 11 million views.<br>
					<br> I also expect the two worlds of live video and
					influencers to collide in 2017, with product placement and
					sponsorships becoming a regular feature of influencer videos.
					Finally, The Truman Show comes to life.<br>
					<br> <b>3.Using all the big data</b><br>
					<br> Big data has been around for a few years now, but getting
					the most out of all this data is still a challenge to many.<br>
					<br> Market research firm Ovum estimates the big data market
					will increase from $1.7 billion in 2016 to $9.4 billion by 2020. As
					businesses mature and put new structures and roles in place, big
					data will begin to become increasingly useful and utilized.<br>
					<br> Big data is becoming increasingly widely used. It is said
					to have played a large part in the outcome of the US election.
					Cambridge Analytica harnessed big data for a variety of uses. Their
					analysis helped the Trump team know where to focus fundraising
					efforts, target ‘persuadables’, and increase spend.<br>
					<br> The data was even used to deliver 4,000 individual
					digital ads. This messaging was continually tested and refined
					using polling and the firm’s data.<br>
					<br><b> 4.Increased personalization</b><br>
					<br> Big data can have a variety of uses, one of them being
					personalized customer experience and marketing. The personalization
					of Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify show how data can be used to
					improve the customer experience. This level of one-to-one marketing
					will slowly become more prevalent as brands weigh opportunity and
					cost and find ways of introducing it into their messaging.<br>
					<br> In marketing, data has been used for the lighthearted but
					enjoyable campaigns such as Spotify’s “Thanks 2016, It’s been
					weird”, to Chelsea football club’s search for a new sponsor, which
					was a highly personalized campaign (see video below).<br>
					<br><b> 5. Digital marketing trends that are on the list every
					year but still deserve to be there:</b><br>
					<br> ▍ Mobile first<br>
					<br> Probably on every digital marketing trends list since
					cell phones first had internet capabilities, the relentless
					increase of users accessing the web through mobile means its
					importance continues.<br>
					<br> In fact, this year there were two important markers for
					mobile: Google announcing a mobile-first web index, and the fact
					that mobile traffic has overtaken desktop for internet usage.

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">
					▍ AR & VR<br>
					<br> The progress is probably slower than people would like,
					as this is another trend that’s been on many a list. I’ve even
					talked about it in this post, and I do believe its use will
					increase, but it is unlikely to develop beyond a niche market in
					2017.<br>
					<br> ▍ More video<br>
					<br> It feels like my entire Facebook feed is already taken up
					by video, but I’m sure there is room for more. Facebook has driven
					profits by embracing video, and is likely to continue. Twitter are
					banking on broadcasting NFL games to boost their revenue. It seems
					we can’t get enough of video, so expect the powers that be to serve
					up even more.<br>
					<br> <b>6. Things that everyone will predict to trend but
					probably won’t quite move as fast as they are expecting:</b><br>
					<br>▍ The Internet of Things<br>
					<br> There are billions of connected devices, from thermostats
					to smart cars. And yet, the biggest Internet of Things news this
					year was the massive DDoS attack in October caused by weaponizing
					low-security connected devices.<br>
					<br> The Internet of Things has some exciting early uses.
					There are industries that are seeing a lot of value from IoT, but
					for most people it’s a slow crawl. Developments will continue to
					creep into our lives, but it feels like people are expecting too
					much too soon.

					<p style="line-height:170%" align="justify">▍ Chatbots<br><br>

Chatbots will be a trend in 2017, but don’t expect to be talking to Scarlett Johansson in Her anytime soon.</p>
