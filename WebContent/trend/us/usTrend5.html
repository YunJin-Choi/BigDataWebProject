					<b>1. Go native or go home.</b><br>
					<br> Joe Pulizzi, a self-proclaimed content-marketing
					evangelist, calls native advertising the “gateway drug” to content
					marketing. If you’re smart, you’ll jump on the native-marketing
					train: Spending on these ads will reach $7.9 billion this year and
					$21 billion by 2018. Native advertising is expected to expand
					across numerous online platforms.
					 Marketers love this form of paid media because it fits
					organically. Native advertising doesn’t disrupt the user
					experience, so users can’t differentiate between what is paid
					advertising and what is part of the site. The content usually is useful, interesting and targeted
					to a specific audience -- all of which makes it one of the best
					platforms to launch any marketing campaign.<br>
					<br> <b>2. Embrace content marketing.</b><br>
					<br> Content marketing sometimes is confused with native
					marketing. Though the two often go hand in hand, content marketing
					is its own beast.Native marketing is simply another way for marketers to
					distribute content. Content marketing is a strategic-marketing
					technique to create and distribute relevant information to attract
					a target audience. It's not a paid-and-done transaction, like
					placing a native ad. Rather, it's an ongoing process that's best
					integrated into an overall marketing strategy. It can serve as the cornerstone to nearly any marketing
					plan and works for all types of brands because everyone uses it
					differently. The key is to be consistent, staying in character for
					your brand. If that brand voice is clever, interesting or funny,
					your target audience can't help but be engaged.<br>
					<br> <b>3. Find your target influencer.</b><br>
					<br> We're now in the midst of an influencer-marketing gold
					rush. While “influencers” always have been a leading element in
					marketing, they're quickly becoming one of the most effective ways
					to reach customers and clients. That's especially true on social
					media.<br>
					<br> Influencer marketing gives brands the opportunity to
					create word-of-mouth buzz through personalities whom consumers
					already follow and admire. These personalities present a world of
					possibilities for any marketer savvy enough to channel their power.
					When influencers are used effectively, they create natural ways to
					seduce a target audience.<br>
					<br> <b>4. Experiment with livestreaming video and visual
					storytelling.</b><br>
					<br> Video connects immediately to the viewer, conveying
					emotion and a message that often is far more memorable than static
					words in a newsfeed.<br>
					<br> Livestreaming video allows you to do this all on the fly.
					Consider the popularity of video-sharing sites such as YouTube.
					More than 1 billion people use YouTube on a regular basis, a number
					that has increased about 40 percent since March 2014.<br>
					<br> Facebook got into the act in a big way in April when it
					launched Facebook Live. The tool puts broadcast capabilities at the
					fingertips of everyone who uses the world's biggest social-media
					network. In October, Facebook followed up with an international ad
					campaign to help raise awareness of how the new feature works. All
					of the campaign's content was shot using Facebook Live and a phone.
					The demonstration was a highly effective way to showcase how the
					new feature allows anyone to create content, from virtually
					anywhere. <br>
					<br><b> 5. Learn how chatbots are changing our conversations.</b><br>
					<br> Chatbots are a major game-changer that improves
					real-time, 24-hour engagement with consumers. Advances in
					artificial intelligence and programming enable chatbots to answer
					customers' queries. The responses make sense because they're all
					based in data on how the human brain works. A chatbot essentially
					is the sales associate who never sleeps and always is ready with a
					prompt reply.<br>
					<br> If you own an iPhone, you have a chatbot in your pocket:
					Siri. Apple's mainstream chatbot uses voice recognition, a preset
					script and deep-learning neural networks to accurately respond to
					users’ questions and statements.<br>
					<br><b> 6. Give your social content an expiration date.</b><br>
					<br> Snapchat fans know there's something alluring and even
					addicting about sending content that will self-destruct within a
					certain timeframe. Generation Z’s decreasing attention span will
					make expiring social content even more crucial. The element of
					urgency cuts through online noise and clutter, instantly capturing
					the user's attention. <br>
					<br> The premise is simple: Look now, or lose your chance
					forever. While this makes the content compelling and authentic, it
					also can prove difficult for marketers to use. Those brands savvy
					enough to harness its potential are finding it has an amazing
					upside. Influencers who are deft at this form of communication can
					help marketers organically integrate expiring social content into
					an overall strategy. <br>
					<br> <b>7. Make personalization a priority.<br></b>
					<br> A daily dose of information overload has made people more
					resistant to advertising. Today's consumers can spot obvious sales
					pitches or marketing come-ons, and they'll be turned off by
					anything they perceive as more clamor. Targeting consumers on an
					individual level allows marketers to cut through the torrent of
					stimuli.<br>
					<br> To capture a distracted customer’s attention, marketers
					must reach him or her with personalized, relevant content. It’s all
					about creating marketing tactics that home in on exactly what
					consumers are looking for or thinking about.<br>
					<br> Tracking consumers’ habits, interests and browsing
					histories is key to creating strategies that get them to close the
					sale or purchase the service.<br>
					<br><b> 8. Automate your efforts.</b><br>
					<br> Marketing automation is growing at an impressive rate,
					with 71 percent of companies currently using this tech. Marketing
					automation does exactly what the name suggests, using software
					platforms designed to put repetitive tasks on autopilot. This tool
					kit includes solutions for email marketing, social-media marketing,
					SMS and digital ads.<br>
					<br> Apps such as Marketo and Hubspot are becoming smarter,
					more intuitive and more affordable. That makes them essential for
					any competitive marketer. In fact, 91 percent of the most
					successful marketers agree that marketing automation is “very
					important” to the overall success of their marketing across
					channels.
