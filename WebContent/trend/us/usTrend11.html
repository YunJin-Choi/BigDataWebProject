					<b>1. Echo Chambers</b><br>
					<br> As we self-select our social groups, follows and likes,
					we are increasingly enclosing ourselves in homogeneous
					environments. With the majority of U.S. adults consuming news
					through social media—62%, according to the Pew Research Center and
					the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation—algorithms are
					determining the content of our news feeds.<br>
					<br> Operating in this digital echo chamber reinforces
					existing beliefs, ideas and interests, constructing different
					versions of reality for different people. Understanding this,
					however, allows marketers to address audiences in highly
					specialized segments and create content that specifically appeals
					to each of them. Messages are then amplified by encouraging the
					participants within each segment to share and engage with each
					other.<br>
					<br><b> 2. Interactive Content</b><br>
					<br> Creating a shared experience between your customers and
					your brand keeps your audience active and engaged. Interactive
					content enables the collection of user information and data that
					marketers can use later to create targeted messages about products
					and services. Infographics, games, listicles, calculators or
					quizzes like those found on Playbuzz, are opportunities to turn
					passive consumers into active players. Interactive content creates
					engagement that results in consumers staying longer, sharing and
					buying more and discovering compelling reasons to return to your
					site or page.<br>
					<br> <b>3. Geo-marketing</b><br>
					<br> Integrating location data into marketing strategies is a
					key to creating relevant messaging, targeting offers and providing
					opportunities for customer reviews. The personalization of the
					outreach is increasingly important, as consumers face an avalanche
					of information and choice.<br>
					<br> In addition, because mobile usage accounts for more than
					50% of web traffic, customers are on the move, necessitating
					geo-contextualized messages and services. Digital mapping also
					provides marketers with the analytics and intelligence to inform
					decision-making, which translates into a greater ability to address
					issues or exploit trends by geographic region or specific physical
					location.<br>
					<br> Understanding the role these trends play will help you
					take your marketing strategies to the next level and connect on a
					deeper level with your target consumer. Yeshiva University’s master
					of science in marketing program addresses these challenges to equip
					you to adapt as marketing trends evolve. To learn more, visit us
