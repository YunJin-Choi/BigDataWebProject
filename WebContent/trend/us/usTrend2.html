					<b>1. Interactive Content</b><br>
					<br> There’s content you can read, and then there’s content
					you can interact with. The second variety tends to be more popular.
					For example, BuzzFeed’s “Which City Should You Live In?” quiz has
					been one of their home-run pieces. Think of ways to get readers to
					actively participate instead of passively consume. Interactive
					content can include assessments (such as the classic Cosmo Quiz
					setup), polls, surveys, infographics, brackets and contests.<br>
					<br><b> 2. Influencer Marketing</b><br>
					<br> What’s more effective than an ad in selling your product?
					A lovable social media personality speaking highly about your
					product to his or her fans and followers. Influencer marketing is
					on the rise, because people tend to trust recommendations from
					people they see as thought leaders. The right influencers establish
					credibility through each social media post or advertisement. When
					they work with brands, it’s because they genuinely believe in them,
					and that trust is passed on to consumers.<br>
					<br> <b>3. Mobile Video</b><br>
					<br> Have you looked at your Facebook feed recently? Chances
					are that 95% of it is video. And here’s a fun stat: mobile video
					views grew six times faster than desktop views in 2015. In fact, in
					Q4 of 2015, mobile video views exceeded desktop views for the first
					time ever. We now live in an age of mobile video, and it’s time we
					embraced it.<br>
					<br> <b>4. Livestreaming</b><br>
					<br> Although we’re still working out the kinks of this
					technology, it’s clear that livestreaming will continue to push the
					boundaries. A big step in this direction was Instagram’s
					integration of a livestream option into its Stories feature. We’re
					going to see a lot more live broadcasts in 2017.<br>
					<br> <b>5. Chatbots</b><br>
					<br> “When you think of chatbots, you probably think of an
					annoying popup on a website that looks like it was built in the mid
					’90s,” says Adam Toren, founder of Young Entrepreneur and
					BizWarriors, a forum for entrepreneurs. He explains that chatbot
					technology has become much more sophisticated. A great example is
					the behemoth Facebook, which invests a significant amount of
					resources into bot programs that provide users with news updates,
					personalized responses and more. Are you talking to a human or a
					bot? If you can’t tell, then the bot is working as intended.<br>
					<br><b>6. Virtual and augmented reality</b><br/>
					<br/> One of 2016’s biggest highlights was watching a
					screen-afflicted population carry their mobile devices out into the
					world to catch, yes, Pokemon. The biggest takeaway from this
					phenomenon was augmented reality’s ability to drive real business
					results. This has become a seriously viable option for marketers
					looking to bring the online into the real world.<br>
					<br><b>7. Short-lived content</b><br>
					<br> What gives Snapchat its appeal? The fact that the content
					disappears. Snapchat’s rampant rise in popularity did a lot more
					for the world of social media than just give users another platform
					to choose from. It showed the value of disappearing or short-lived
					content. This is a key attraction for Generation Z, the cohort
					famous for having an eight-second attention span, and is why you
					should be integrating short-lived content into your content
					strategy.<br>
					<br><b> 8. Mobile First Strategy</b><br>
					<br> The future is mobile. Internet traffic is now coming more
					from mobile devices than desktops. If you’re not catering your
					content, ads and online experience to a mobile user, then you are
					missing a massive opportunity. And remember: It’s not just about
					“optimizing” for mobile; it’s also about making sure that piece of
					content gets integrated with a user’s lifestyle on the go.<br>
					<br><b> 9. Personalization</b><br>
					<br> Personalization means segmenting your content to reach
					different types of audience members based on their preferences,
					habits, etc. The most common form of this strategy is through
					lists, where certain content gets sent to certain types of users
					based on which lists they’ve opted into. In a world of too much
					content and not enough time, personalization is a huge win for
					brands looking to earn the attention of their consumers.<br>
					<br> <b>10. Native Advertising</b><br>
					<br> Viewers, followers and consumers are getting wise to the
					tricks of advertisers, and it’s becoming harder and harder to
					maintain their attention and earn their trust. Native advertising
					means integrating your advertising efforts into content that
					already provides value to readers and viewers. For this reason, it
					tends to be more effective. Look for ways to weave your products
					and offerings into a larger narrative, instead of just blasting
					people with ads.<br>
					<br> <b>11. Marketing Automation</b><br>
					<br> Why do the same thing over and over again when you can do
					it once and automate the rest? Automation is becoming extremely
					powerful (and popular) among marketers and businesses who are
					looking to scale and expand past trading hours. As apps such as
					Marketo and Hubspot become more intuitive and affordable,
					automation will become more common.<br>
					<br> <b>12. Purpose Driven Marketing</b><br>
					<br> One of the most effective ways to extend your story is to
					give it a feel-good element. Brands that partner with nonprofits or
					charities, or set up internal programs that “give back” in some way
					(TOMS shoes comes to mind) have a much stronger presence because
					their story resonates with the hearts of consumers.<br>
					<br> <b>13. Data Driven Marketing</b><br>
					<br> There are two types of marketers: those who want to use
					what’s popular and those who use what works, regardless of whether
					it’s popular or not. Data tells you what’s really moving the
					needle, and the truth is that every marketer needs to be conscious
					of it. If you aren’t fluent in Facebook ads and conversion ratios,
					for example, then you’re missing a crucial part of every marketer’s
					essential toolbox.<br>
					<br> <b>14. Social Media “Buy” Buttons</b><br>
					<br> We are moving into an age where purchasing doesn’t need
					to happen on a third-party site. Users are on a social platform, so
					why should they have to leave in order to buy something? “Buy”
					buttons are quickly turning social media sites such as Facebook and
					Pinterest into social shopping experiences.<br>
					<br><b> 15. Dark Social</b><br>
					<br> The hardest part about tracking traffic, conversions and
					shares is that you’re not always sure what the sources are. With
					the rise of encrypted and private messaging apps (where people
					still share lots of content with each other), you may want to
					invest in tools, such as Google Analytics and GetSocial.io, that
					can measure, to some degree, where this “dark” traffic is coming
					from.<br>
					<br><b> 16. Embrace The lOT</b><br>
					<br> Should your thermostat talk to you? How about a
					refrigerator that informs you when you’re low on milk, and then
					gives you the option to place an order immediately? Everyday
					objects are beginning to connect to the internet, and this trend is
					going to open doors for brands and marketers to integrate with the
					everyday lives of consumers. Watch this trend closely, because it’s
					going to boom!<br>
					<br> <b>17. Beyond Viewability</b><br>
					<br> Currently, most companies use viewability to measure to
					their success. Instead of solely focusing on views or clicks,
					companies should measure their ROI on things such as sign-ups,
					downloads and purchases. This requires going beyond CPMs and
					looking at the performance-based metrics instead.
