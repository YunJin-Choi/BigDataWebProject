					<b>1. Snap’s Evolution Will Result in Interesting New Opportunities.</b><br>
					<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First up, I’d like to mention the enormous evolution
					Snapchat—now called Snap—has undergone, and where it may be headed
					in the future. Already, Snap has transformed user expectations and
					major trends in the social marketing world. It’s helped bring back
					a more moment-focused view of communication, leading to more
					in-the-moment and live content, it’s facilitated more
					mobile-centric app developments, and it’s introduced vertical
					videos into the mainstream. But now, it’s looking to develop
					products outside its main means of exchanging messages, introducing
					real-world glasses to help users capture first-person visual
					information. Expect big things from this recently-renamed company
					in 2017, and huge marketing opportunities to go along with them.<br>
					<br> <b>2. Twitter Fatigue Will Worsen.</b><br>
					<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twitter isn’t doing so hot. People have been predicting
					the death of Twitter for the past few years, but I’m not here to
					say whether or not Twitter’s going to survive another year (it
					probably will). Instead, I’d like to point out one potential factor
					for the app’s decline, what I call “Twitter fatigue.” Twitter built
					itself on fast, bite-sized updates, but this leads to a barrage of
					both incoming and outgoing tweets. This was novel and exciting at
					first, but now users are starting to crave something
					different—bigger, more detailed, more interesting pieces of content
					that roll out slower, like once per day. You can see this trend
					taking hold already in platforms like Instagram.<br>
					<br><b>3. Users Will Crave More Vicarious Experiences.</b><br>
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People are also starting to demand social media as a
					conduit for more vicarious experiences. It’s no longer enough to
					post your sentiments about an event; you have to show your users
					what it’s like to be there. You can do this with things like live
					video, 360 images and video, and even just more real-time posting.
					The idea is to make your users feel like they’re a genuine part of
					the experience, as it’s unfolding.<br>
					<br><b> 4. New Areas of Communication Will Emerge.</b><br>
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historically, social media existed as a way for
					individual people to communicate online. When brands caught on, it
					also became a way for brands to speak to and advertise to
					consumers. But now, social media is evolving in new communicative
					areas. Some platforms are offering means of customer service,
					increasing the significance and interactivity of exchanges between
					brands and consumers. Others, like Facebook, are delving into more
					professional communication. Expect to see more diversity here as
					more brands catch onto the potential.<br>
					<br><b> 5. An Ad Renaissance Will Occur.</b><br>
					<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organic visibility has been declining for a while now, as
					platforms try catering to individual users over companies and
					organizations. But the secondary benefit for social platforms is
					that it forces more companies to dabble in paid advertising.
					Increased competition and pressure to become (or remain) profitable
					have also forced social platforms to come up with more ingenious
					and creative advertising options for businesses. The combination of
					these factors may lead to a new resurgence in social media
					advertising in 2017.<br>
					<br><b> 6. Inspiration and Imagination Will Become Fashionable.</b><br>
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practical posts get a lot of consumer attention.
					Emotionally charged posts have a greater likelihood of circulating
					virally. But inspirational and imaginative posts are starting to
					make their appearances as even stronger candidates for social media
					success. These are often artistic in nature, giving users something
					“pretty” as opposed to something pragmatic or reactive. It also
					forces a separation from any kind of company positioning or low-key
					advertising, giving users something truly valuable. In 2017, it
					will be valuable to forgo some pretense here, and just post
					beautiful images or sentiments.<br>
					<br><b> 7. Brands Will Choose Social Platforms According to
					Survival of the Fittest.</b><br>
					<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, new social media platforms emerge to try and
					disrupt the status quo or find their place among the heavy-hitters
					of the social media world. But obviously, entrepreneurs and
					marketers can’t jump on every single platform that comes along.
					Instead, in 2017, we’ll see more of a trend toward refinement;
					rather than spending equal effort on five different platforms, more
					businesses will find one platform that works especially well for
					them, and narrow their focus on it. As a result, we may see greater
					stratification between the major platforms of our era.
