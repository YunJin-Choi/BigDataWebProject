					<b>1. High Fashion (Kate Spade)</b><br>
					<br> Wearables have, for the most part, been boring. Either as
					a bracelet or a watch (usually made some combination of rubber and
					plastic), these adornments don’t spark fashion-conscious consumers’
					imaginations. While functional, these devices have traditionally
					been far from fashionable. That’s changing in a big way with many
					companies adding flair to fitness trackers.<br>
					<br> Kate Spade, for example, has tracking bangles and other
					wearables that can work on the track or a night out. (More
					importantly, they actually complement your wardrobe.) Swarovski
					also offers a line of activity trackers that sparkle as they track
					your sleep habits. And even Fossil, which acquired Misfit back in
					2015, is rumored to be expanding into wearables, even pushing its
					brand beyond smartwatches.<br>
					<br> By highlighting a multiuse experience, your brand can use
					wearables to truly become part of your audience’s life and
					aesthetic, serving as a form of expression.<br>
					<br> <b>2. Increased Connectivity (Disney)</b><br>
					<br> Family vacations are supposed to be fun, especially when
					you’re going to the “happiest place on Earth.” You may think you’re
					saving time and stress by booking a stay at a Disney Resort prior
					to your dream vacation. However, there’s still meals, reservations,
					and park tickets to keep track of—along with your very excited
					children.<br>
					<br> Disney understands that consumers’ happiness means a
					potential increase in spending, which is why the Magic Band is a
					great example of a smart marketing trend using wearable technology.
					The Magic Band connects to MyDisney Experience to keep track of
					your hotel room access and FastPass+ Selections, along with food
					and merchandise purchases. Magic Bands also feature all the most
					popular Disney and Star Wars characters, and as a bonus, Magic Band
					owners can unlock personalized experiences during their vacation.<br>
					<br> For Disney, it’s a great win as it keeps users extremely
					happy while collecting a lot of data on patrons. It’s a seamless
					experience with the type of connectivity consumers expect from
					their technology.<br>
					<br> Your brand might not offer Disney-level interactions, but
					users do experience your brand every day. Think about the ways in
					which users come in contact with your brand—then get creative in
					providing enhanced access to those touch points. For example, if
					you’re in human resources and often recruit potential employees,
					maybe part of your package is an app that connects with a user’s
					smartwatch, guiding them around the neighborhood and highlighting
					your employee’s favorite bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and other
					spaces as they kill time before their next interview.<br>
					<br> <b>3. All-Day Technology (Under Armour)</b><br>
					<br> An athletic apparel company using a wearable is a
					no-brainer—as long as you know why your audience is using them.
					Users of Fitbits, Nike Fuelbands, and UA Bands, for example, all
					look to their devices to help them study their bodies. Why? Because
					if you want to set a new personal record, lose weight, or live a
					healthy lifestyle, you need to understand how your body responds to
					the work you’re doing.<br>
					<br> Under Armour gets that. The brand has developed has a
					whole line of Smart Gear, from running sneakers that help you
					understand how you should be running to sleepwear that claims to
					help you recover better. For any brand with a young, energetic
					audience, it’s important to realize that marketing doesn’t stop
					when they stop. Find ways to maximize their potential in all facets
					of their life and they’ll live happier, healthier, and with your
					product on them.<br>
					<br><b> 4. Omnipresence (Fitbit)</b><br>
					<br> Part of the hype surrounding VR and augmented reality is
					the idea of tech transporting us beyond our physical location. I
					can swim with dolphins from New York City or enhance my
					neighborhood with landmarks that come to life via an app.<br>
					<br> Fitbit is blurring reality further with the release of
					its Adventure app. The hiking trails of Yosemite National Park are
					now part of your morning jog with Fitbit’s app that connects to all
					of its devices. The company also rewards users with fun trivia or
					advice to continue living a healthy life. Through Adventures,
					Fitbit provides its users with a holistic experience, the heart of
					which is the wearable. The campaign creates an interactive form of
					storytelling driven by what you’re wearing on your wrist.<br>
					<br> For brands, the big takeaway here is that wearables are
					the canvas for a broad swath of content types. When it comes to
					wearables, don’t limit your brand to devices; instead, let them sit
					at the root of your next experience.<br>
					<br> <b>5. Everyday Enhancement (Ford)</b><br>
					<br> A distracted driver is an unsafe driver. Instead of
					giving users one more thing to worry about, Ford is exploring
					wearables to make driving a better overall experience for your
					health. Augmented reality is already a much talked about feature
					that’s being implemented in more cars (think heads-up displays that
					show gas levels or miles per hour on your windshield), and Volvo
					even has in-car delivery to make errands a walk in the park.<br>
					<br> The Ford Wearables lab is looking at the technology to
					monitor the health and well-being of drivers for safer experiences.
					The car manufacturer is also exploring ways to connect driver
					assistance technology to wearables. A wearable now goes beyond just
					tracking your health. It can actually improve your driving
					experience, which unlocks a lot of interesting marketing
					possibilities. Imagine wearing a fitness tracker that’s connected
					to your car that adjusts the sensitivity of the vehicle’s lane
					detection if it detects sleepiness or increased heart rate.<br>
					<br> Wearables are no longer limited to wrists, with many
					affordable options capable of delivering breathtaking experiences.
					Companies have a reason to be excited with VR, and several of these
					campaigns prove there’s plenty of potential in smartwatches and
					fitness trackers. By embracing the interactivity and versatility of
					the wearables, these content marketing trends can unlock memorable
					campaigns.
