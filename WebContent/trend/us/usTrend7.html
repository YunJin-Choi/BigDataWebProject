					<b>Trend 1: Buying influencers</b><br>
					<br> As Robert Rose and I covered in a recent This Old
					Marketing podcast, CNN bought the social media app Beme owned by
					YouTube celebrity Casey Neistat who amassed 6 million followers
					through his video blog. CNN is shutting down the app and asking
					Casey and his team to start a new media platform.<br>
					<br> Basically, CNN is looking to target a new audience, one
					that it believes Neistat holds the keys to. Instead of organically
					growing a platform or finding a leader within its ranks, CNN just
					went out and purchased Neistat and his team for $25 million.<br>
					<br> <b>Trend 2: Content marketing as defensive mechanism</b><br>
					<br> Earlier this month, Kellogg’s pulled its advertising from
					Breitbart.com, which has been in the news a lot since
					President-elect Donald Trump named Steve Bannon, Breitbart’s former
					chairman, as a top adviser. Breitbart, which Bannon proclaimed is
					the “platform for the alt-right,” has a very particular point of
					view, and one that Kellogg’s doesn’t agree with.<br>
					<br> Hence, the removal of Kellogg’s advertising from
					Breitbart’s site.<br>
					<br> To combat this, Breitbart aggressively came after
					Kellogg’s with a #DumpKelloggs campaign, where Alexander Marlow,
					Breitbart News editor-in-chief stated, “Boycotting Breitbart News
					for presenting mainstream American ideas is an act of
					discrimination and intense prejudice.” The campaign trended on
					Twitter and was picked up by all the major news outlets.<br>
					<br> According to FiveThirtyEight, Breitbart.com’s traffic
					increased at a faster rate than almost every other media site
					during the election process. Whether you agree with its site or
					not, there is power in its audience and growth.<br>
					<br> Kellogg’s simply has no power to combat this. Sure, it
					can send out a news release and talk with the press. It can do an
					ad in The Wall Street Journal or some other outlet, but Breitbart
					has a huge audience of followers and can basically attack anyone it
					wants without repercussion.<br>
					<br> In the future, how does Kellogg’s combat this? How does
					any company combat a situation when an organization with a large
					audience comes after them?<br>
					<br> <b>Trend 3: Backlash against social platforms</b><br>
					<br> As of this writing, YouTube megastar PewDiePie (aka Felix
					Kjellberg) has been extremely critical of YouTube over the past few
					months. Specifically, PewDiePie believes that YouTube’s algorithm
					changes are costing him traffic, which is hurting his advertising
					revenues and other sponsorship opportunities.<br>
					<br> On Dec. 2, in one of his videos PewDiePie said he’s so
					frustrated about the matter, that when he hit 50 million
					subscribers he was going to shut down his account. Of course,
					PewDiePie hit his 50 million subscribers and decided to keep his
					channel (essentially trolling the internet). That said, he
					continues to rant about YouTube and its algorithm changes.<br>
					<br> Honestly, the details don’t really matter. More and more
					social media influencers, as well as brands leveraging social
					media, are frustrated with YouTube, Facebook, and more, and their
					ongoing algorithm changes. For example, BP has been moving away
					from Facebook to publish more on LinkedIn as more and more of its
					Facebook content goes unseen.<br>
					<br><b> Trend 4: Email renaissance</b><br>
					<br> According to Campaign Monitor, social media darling
					BuzzFeed added over 1 million email subscribers in the past 12
					months. How? The answer can be found in trend No. 3. With social
					media channels moving toward revenue growth, brands have almost no
					control over communicating with fans and followers. Of all the ways
					to grow an audience, email has emerged as THE most critical.<br>
					<br> Other media brands are following suit. For example, The
					Washington Post now has over 75 e-newsletters, while The New York
					Times has 12 people dedicated to newsletters. While some believe
					email is dead, the media is telling us that email is a growth area.
					And last but not least, our CMI/MarketingProfs B2B study found that
					email was rated as the No. 1 success metric for measuring content
					marketing.

					<b>Trend 5: Print resurgence</b><br> <br> Airbnb and publishing
					partner Hearst recently announced the launch of a new print
					magazine appropriately called Airbnb mag. The magazine will be
					distributed to Airbnb homes and include content created and curated
					from people who provide and use the Airbnb service.

					<p style="line-height:170%" align="justify">Not to be outdone, School of Doodle just launched a print magazine as did VFiles.<br> <br>

And, not that you’ve noticed, but print magazines as a tactic for content marketers have been steady for the past couple of years (according to our research).  I believe we’ve hit a bottom in print’s decline as more marketers look to cut through the digital clutter with (what else?) print.</p>
