					<b>Intuition versus Market Research</b><br>
					<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many companies in Japan rely on common sense and
					intuition when developing products for launch rather than lengthy
					and expensive market research. They will often follow their
					intuition and launch a new product on a small scale and then
					incrementally scale and improve it based on the feedback they get
					from actual customers. This makes a lot of sense when you consider
					that a high percentage of new products that flop despite extensive
					market testing and research. It is extremely difficult to
					accurately predict consumer behavior as even the best executed
					research can be dead wrong. Many internet companies take this
					approach by releasing a beta version of their site and continuously
					improving upon it.<br>
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imitation and Churning The authors of Relentless observe
					that Japanese companies are very adept at quickly imitating
					innovations. When one company launches a unique product, the
					competition is quick to go to market with similar versions.
					Churning refers to the fast cycle of innovation and imitation.
					Churning makes it difficult for anyone to maintain a first mover
					advantage but the positive is that consumers are less afraid to be
					early adapters since several companies have created a similar
					product. This helps the whole category to grow and this inherently
					helps the leader although there is less of a first mover advantage.
					This also creates an environment that encourages fast adoption of
					new technology.<br>
					<br> <b>The Buyer is the Master<br></b>
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are obviously many differences in the culture in
					Japan, and one that can be striking is the relationship between
					buyer and seller. Too often in the US, the buyer is at the mercy of
					the seller, take auto mechanics or cell phone carriers for
					instance. Also, buyers in the US often have a confrontational
					approach with sellers who may try to push things they don’t need or
					charge the highest price possible. In Japan the buyer is the master
					and the seller is like a servant. This changes the whole dynamic of
					how products are sold and marketed. The seller is concerned with
					what the buyer wants, rather than what they want to sell. When the
					customer’s interest is put before the profit of the company, this
					can lead to strong and lasting relationships between the buyer and
					seller. Many Japanese Companies do not have “Marketers”<br>
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Japan, often marketing is part of everyone’s job in
					the company rather than a specialized department with specialized
					professionals in marketing. As a result many companies do not have
					marketing managers. While I don’t necessarily think US companies
					should get rid of their marketing departments, a lot of successful
					companies do little or no formal marketing. In Japan, the quality
					of their products speak louder than any commercial.
