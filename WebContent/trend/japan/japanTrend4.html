					<b>1. Tap into emotional trends</b><br>
					<br> The emotional palette differs by vertical, but overall
					warmth is the easiest emotion to evoke among Japanese audiences.
					Toyota's “Loving Eyes” made it into both the 2015 and 2016 top 10
					most shared Autos ads lists because it attracted intense feelings
					of warmth among viewers (25% vs. a market average of 7%).<br>
					<br> <b>2.Alternatively, gain cut-through by utilising a less
					common emotion</b> <br>
					<br> Amazement isn’t an emotion typically used in FMCG video
					ads, but Shiseido used this to great effect in “High School Girl” -
					earning it a 36% share of views in 2015/16, plus the number one
					spot in the top 10 most shared video ads chart (the ad evoked
					amazement in 23% of viewers vs. a global vertical norm of 4%).<br>
					<br> <b>3. Give your audience a reason to share</b><br>
					<br> Social utility, to seek opinions and shared passions are
					key reasons why Japanese viewers share content online. Both last
					year and the year before, Auto brands have been particularly
					effective at utilising shared passion as a reason to share. For
					example 18% of Japanese viewers would share Audi's “TT Landing” in
					order to connect with other Audi fans (vs. a global vertical norm
					of 10%).<br>
					<br> <b>4. Tailor videos for the Japanese market</b><br>
					<br> Include cultural elements, values or locations in Japan
					to make your content more personal and authentic. AU's “Santaro”
					series, featuring traditional Japanese heroes, made it into both
					the top 10 most shared lists for last year and the year before and
					helped to give the brand 34% of the total shares for Tech in
					2015/16 and 14% last year.<br>
					<br> <b>5. Use paid media to ensure your strong content reaches a
					wide audience</b><br>
					<br> Volkswagen, Haagen Dazs and Asahi all featured in the top
					10 most shared brands of 2016, attracting 2%, 7% and 7% shares of
					voice among their respective verticals, but none made it into the
					most viewed chart - meaning their strong, engaging content didn't
					reach its full potential with viewers. If you’re onto a winner then
					maximise it’s potential.<br>
					<br><b> 6. Consider making content for mobile distribution</b><br>
					<br> Japanese audiences are more engaged on mobile devices -
					with click-through, interaction and video completion rates all
					higher on mobile than on desktop - 7.7% vs. 5.8%, 10.7% vs. 7.4%
					and 59.2% vs. 52.1% respectively.<br>
					<br> The metrics for mobile campaigns in Japan also
					significantly outperform the global norms - +175% for CTR, +182%
					for interaction rate and +5% for video completion. Japanese mobile
					audiences are not only more engaged than those on desktop, but are
					also more engaged than their global counterparts.
