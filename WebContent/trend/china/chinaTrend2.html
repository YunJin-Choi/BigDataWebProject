					<b>10 media and marketing trends in China</b>
				</h3>
				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">GroupM China has
					issued its latest This Year, Next Year report, showing China’s
					changing media landscape and predicting the future trends for
					marketers:</p>

				<img src="images/imgTrend/a3.jpg" alt="trend2"
					style="width: 550px; height: 350px; margin-left: 80px">

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">
					<b>1. Internet ad spend is taking nearly half of the total,
						while mobile advertising will become the most popular online media
						advertising type</b>
				</p>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internet
					ad spending in China has surpassed television spending for the
					first time in 2015, and it’s forecasted to take up 49.7% of the
					total ad spend. Mobile screen has become the first screen of
					consumers and mobile internet ad is expected to grow twice as fast
					as that of the overall internet ad spend.</p>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">
					<b>2. Programmatic purchase will see deepening development</b>
				</p>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite
					their ever increasing budgets on programmatic purchase, big
					advertisers are focusing not only on efficiency and effectiveness
					but also the quality of advertising resources and advertising
					environment. A combo of PDB + RTB purchase of advertisements has
					become the mainstream model.</p>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">
					<b>3. Television continues to play a dominant role in terms of
						coverage and influence despite lowering market share</b>
				</p>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
					further development of the new interactive approaches via
					television such as “WeChat shake” and “watch and shop” is
					anticipated to accelerate the fusion of new media and traditional
					media. The organic combination of “Wechat + television” is more of
					a “new volume entrance” plus a “new advertising platform” than just
					a mere shaking to obtain free cash red packets. The combination has
					created added value of television by gradually transforming the
					latter from content display media to content interactive media.</p>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">
					<b>4. More subtle product placements in variety shows</b>
				</p>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
					2015, the most expensive advertising endorsement in one variety
					show was as much as CNY 500 million, arriving at a new level.
					However, recent years have detected a pervasive bottleneck in ad
					volume and price because of restrictions on advertising. Media and
					advertising companies started to diversify how they promote brands
					through more dimensions with more subtlety. There are more
					interactions with fans and more crossover marketing for the sake of
					speedy integration of multi-screen interaction and
					television-Internet linkage.</p>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">
					<b>5. Variety shows are one of CCTV’s top priorities in 2016,
						while dramas and sports event broadcasting rights are unparalleled
						advantages</b>
				</p>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2016
					is surely a big year for sports event. The exclusive television
					rights and new media broadcasting rights now enjoyed by CCTV in
					China mainland and Macau have helped CCTV in winning the favour of
					advertisers. This could be seen in the competition of title
					sponsorship for the Olympic programs and the Olympic medal tally.</p>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">
					<b>6. PSTVs remain a key driver for TV expenditure growth as
						LTVs group together</b>
				</p>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
					ad spend in PSTVs increased 13.8% in 2015, and 6.0% this year.
					Hunan PSTV, Zhejiang PSTV, Jiangsu PSTV and Dragon TV firmly held
					the top 4 spots. Meanwhile, LTVs were riding on the advantage of
					local coverage by ground channels and nationwide coverage of online
					video network to build up their core competitiveness through
					alliancing themselves. This innovative model provided new options
					for advertisers.</p>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">
					<b>7. The online video market has increased by 61.2%
						year-on-year</b>
				</p>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
					future, online video websites’ current business model of solely
					relying on advertising revenue will be replaced by a series of eco
					models. These will range from content investment, big data,
					systematic purchase, video-based e-commerce, Internet finance and
					online payment. Brand owners need to understand that brand
					advertising is to provide premium entertainment content to the
					audience instead of creating disturbance for them.</p>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">
					<b>8. “Scenario will be the king” in OOH</b>
				</p>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
					huge market potential and broad prospects for development indicate
					that investing extensively in OOH advertising in the third- tier
					and fourth-tier cities, is a useful proposition. Nowadays as
					consumers spend an increasing amount of time outdoors, it is
					critical for outdoor advertisers to strengthen interactions and
					increase convergence of new technologies. Technologies such as
					augmented reality, beacons and virtual reality are set to reshape
					the outlook of outdoor advertising.</p>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">
					<b>9. Printed media’s “transformation and upgradation” and
						media integration elevated to a “national strategy” level</b>
				</p>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
					focusing on developing own content and converging media platforms,
					“transformation and upgradation” have become the new concept in
					content innovation and value enhancement.</p>


				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">
					<b>10. Growth of radio ad spend entered the negative territory
						in 2015 for the first timel</b>
				</p>

				<p style="line-height: 170%" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
					it is expected to be the pioneer media for many advertisers’
					advertising channels in lower-tier cities. Despite attracting a
					large number of listeners last year, the competitiveness of mobile
					radio stations for a sustainable future will mainly lie in three
					aspects: enhancement of self-generated content to increase
					listeners’ adhesiveness, diversification of connections among
					different end devices to cover more scenarios and improvement in
					accuracy and localisation of platform advertising through big data
					+ LBS (Location Based Services).</p>
